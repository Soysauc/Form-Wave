# Form wave animation

This project is inspired by the aforementioned (if my other READMEs have been viewed) 50 projects in 50 days. This project in particular focuses on a styled form block that is styled in such a way that after clicking on input elements the placeholder characters move up in such a way that it is visually appealing. This seems like a fun way to interact with users. I can see myself implementing it in my personal applications.
